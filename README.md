# To Do App

This is a simple React.js app that utilizes functional components and hooks to generate todo lists and items that are then saved to local storage, allowing tasks to persist upon reload.

## Filtering

In the project, I defined filter functionality that allows the user to filter between all tasks, active tasks, or tasks they have marked as completed.

## Edit and Delete

Each task is also defined by an ID unique to that task upon rendering. Individual tasks are then able to be edited or deleted.
